# The-Guarded-Doors
You are in front of a room with three guards. One guard always tells the truth, one always lies, and the third guard randomly tells the truth or lies. There are two doors in the room, one leading to freedom and the other to a deadly trap. One door has a sign that says, "This is the door to freedom," and the other door has a sign that says, "One guard always tells the truth, one guard always lies, and the third guard randomly tells the truth or lies." You can ask only one guard one question to determine which door leads to freedom. What question do you ask, and which door do you choose?

Solution:
Ask any guard the following question: "If I were to ask the other two guards which door leads to freedom, what would they say?" No matter which guard you ask, they will point to the door leading to the deadly trap because both the truthful guard and the lying guard will indicate the same door. Therefore, you should choose the opposite door as the door to freedom.
